# Crimp [![Packagist](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/xpaw/crimp.svg)](https://packagist.org/packages/xpaw/crimp)

A dead simple multi curl implementation.

This is practically a bare bones implemention.
Retrying, HTTP code checking and other stuff is up to the user.

If you need a fully featured multi cURL implemention, take a look at
[Zebra_cURL](https://github.com/stefangabos/Zebra_cURL) or [Guzzle](https://github.com/guzzle/guzzle) instead.
